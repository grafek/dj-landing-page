# DJ Landing page 🎶

A website to showcase my DJ mixes and to get bookings for parties. I'm a mostly house music DJ but I'm not limiting myself to only house music.

## ✔️ TODO

- [x] contact-form validation
- [ ] about page
- [x] obtain messages from the form (emailjs)
- [ ] some animations (framer?)
- [ ] add social media links and playlist ID to my mixes (mock data as of now, 2nd Apr 2023)
- [x] add lazy loading to youtube iframe (heavy bundle)



## 🔥 Features
 (It's just a landing page, so there aren't many features :D)


- [x] youtube iframe api calls w/ react-youtube
- [x] responsive
